UnlimitedPeripheralWorks provides *a* lot of new content to use with CC:T computers:

- Peripherals for minecraft blocks: Beacon, JukeBox, Note block, Lectern and Powered Rail
- Powerful peripherals, that expand limits of world interaction: [[Notes/Minecraft/UnlimitedPeripheralWorks/Universal scanner\|Universal scanner]], Ultimate Sensor, Reality Forger, Statue Workbench, Remote Observer
- Display, item and map pedestals, that allows you not only to display items, but also extract information from it
- Peripheral proxy and peripheralium hub that breaks limitation from CC:T and allows you to build crazy programs with more peripheral that ever before
- Item and recipe registries would definitely provide useful information for your programs

And check out [[Notes/Minecraft/UnlimitedPeripheralWorks/Mod integrations\|Mod integrations]] page to see if your favourite mod was integrated with CC:T and open [issue](https://github.com/SirEdvin/UnlimitedPeripheralWorks/issues/new) if not.
